# Cryptomight-v2
This is a simple 3-tiered encryption platform I made for my Discrete Mathematics class. 
You can encrypt and decrypt messages using user-specified keys within different algorithms.
I used Netbeans 8.1 to make it. 
And additions/suggestions are highly encouraged and appreciated. 

If you have any questions regarding the app's functions email me at gkrose@asu.edu

Thanks and enjoy!
