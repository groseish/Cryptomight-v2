# Cryptomight-v2
This is a simple 3-tiered encryption platform I made for my Discrete Mathematics class. 
You can encrypt and decrypt messages using user-specified keys within different algorithms.
I used Netbeans 8.1 to make it. 
And additions/suggestions are highly encouraged and appreciated. 

Step 1) Clone the repo to a local directory.

Step 2) Open Netbeans 8.2

Step 3) Click 'Open Project' in the File Menu and navigate to the clone /dir/.

Step 4) Open the cryptomight-v2 project. 

Step 5) Play around in the code. When you're ready, click the hammer icon to make a fresh build for your local files. Or just click the big green 'Play' triangle icon to run the app from Netbeans. 

Step 6) Enjoy encrypting your strings!

If you have any questions regarding the app's functions email me at gkrose@asu.edu

Thanks and enjoy!
